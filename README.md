Welcome to the Pizza King Application

To begin using the application, navigate to the "pizza-king" folder.

Then install your front end dependencies by entering "npm install" in your terminal.

Then open a second terminal and navigate to the "api" folder ("cd api").

Next, install your backend dependencies by entering "npm install" in your terminal.

Once dependencies are installed, enter "npm start" in both terminals to start both servers.

Also ensure that you have MongoDB installed. For information, go to https://www.mongodb.com/try.
